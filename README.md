# MicroMacro
This repository contains code for analysing MEG data based on combinations of micro- and macro-scale computational models and is described in D.A. Pinotsis, D.J. Gibson and E.K. Miller, Differences in visually induced MEG oscillations reflect differences in deep cortical layer activity, preprint.  

It contains NEURON files for the symmetric compartmental model that was obtained by adapting the model of S. R. Jones, D. L. Pritchett, S. M. Stufflebeam, M. Hämäläinen, and C. I. Moore, "Neural correlates of tactile detection: a combined magnetoencephalography and biophysically based computational modeling study", The Journal of Neuroscience, vol. 27, no. 40, pp. 10751–10764, 2007. This adaptation is described in D.A. Pinotsis, D.J. Gibson and E.K. Miller, Differences in visually induced MEG oscillations reflect differences in deep cortical layer activity, preprint. 

It also contains a MATLAB implementation of the Bush and Sejnowski neural mass model in the context of the DCM toolbox of SPM12, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/, see also P.C. Bush and T.J. Sejnowski, "Reduced compartmental models of neocortical pyramidal cells", J. Neurosci. Methods, vol. 46, pp.159–166, 1993.
